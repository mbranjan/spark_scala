# Question 2 - Apache Spark:


### Problem Statement:
Need to generate report from International Baseline data of world versus U.S. with % -
1. E.g. for barley, find how much world can harvest from 2016/17 – 2028/29 vs % from US
e.g. (“USA harvest in year” / “World harvest in year”) x 100
2. Final report format would be -
Year|world_barley_harvest|usa_barley_contribution%|world_beef_slaughter|…|usa_wheat_ contribution%

#### Note –
Write Apache Spark + Scala program to achieve solution.
Measurable criteria will be on your coding skill standards and approach.


### Solution:

 - The code is purely built with Spark Dataframe APIs and Spark SQL.
 - Source files are created as per assumptions and are present under "src/test/resources/"
 - An input is taken from configuration file which is present under "src/main/resources/".
 - Sample test cases are written and tested.
 - Result screenshot is uploaded.
